# Topic: *Structural Design Patterns*
## Author: *Drumea Vasile*
------
## Objectives :
__1. Study and understand the Structural Design Patterns;__

__2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about the functionalities that your system will need to provide to the user;__

__3. Implement some additional functionalities using some structural design patterns;__

## Some Theory :
In software engineering, the Structural Design Patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes/abstractions, but the structural object patterns use composition which is generally a more flexible alternative to inheritance.

Some examples of from this category of design patterns are :

   * Adapter
   * Bridge
   * Composite
   * Decorator
   * Facade
   * Flyweight
   * Proxy
   
## Main tasks :
__1. By extending your project, implement atleast 3 structural design patterns in your project;__

__2. Keep your data model files separated from the ones that containt the functionalities (using packages/directories);

__3. Document your work in a separate markdown file or LaTeX report according to the requirements presented below;__

## Evaluation :
__1. The project should be located in the same repository as the previous lab;__

__2. The markdown file or the LaTeX report should have the following standard structure (which can be extended if needed):__

  * Topic of the laboratory work;
  * Author;
  * Introduction/Theory/Motivation;
  * Implementation & Explanation (you can include code snippets as well);
  * Results/Screenshots/Conclusions;

__3. In order to make the evaluation as optimal as possible we will have a quiz on this topic;__

__4. The mark of the lab is based on the project and the quiz;__

__5. Submit the repository URL on ELSE;__

__7. The deadline for this assignment is 07.11.2020;__
